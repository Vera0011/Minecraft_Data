# STARTING
1- First of all, you need to install the package, like this:
```
npm i @veraa/minecraft-data
```
2- Import in your code the object constructor:
```js
const MinecraftData = require("@veraa/minecraft-data");
```
3- The use of the constructor is this one:
```js
const variable = new MinecraftData("language").function(anotherVariable);
```
- **"language"** goes for the language you want to use: available ones are __en__ (english), __es__ (spanish) and __fr__ (french)
- **.function()** is the function you are looking for (for different functions, look at the docs, links below)
- **anotherVariable** goes (if needed) for another variable (for example, if you need to look up after a mob through a name)
